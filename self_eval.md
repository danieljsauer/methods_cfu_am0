# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

    I am proud of combining different things we have learned to put an if,elsif statement inside of a method definition. During my C++ course through codecademy, methods/functions is where things got very cloudy for me, and I feel like I understand them significantly better now. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

    We can call custom made or ruby built methods to modify,reassign, or interpret data. We can apply these methods to an endless amount of different data values, which will greatly save us time and tedious effort. Methods are essentially, in my opinion, what makes computing so powerful.
